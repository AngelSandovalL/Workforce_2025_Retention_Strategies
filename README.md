# Workforce_2025_Retention_Strategies
---
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of employee turnover (attrition) at a manufacturing company, using a dataset that spans a 10-year period (2006-2015).

You can find the original dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/HRAnalyticRepository/employee-attrition-data

## Project Objective
The main objective is to identify the key patterns and factors that influence employee terminations. Through this analysis, the goal is to generate **informed hypotheses** that can serve as a foundation for developing future talent retention strategies, helping the organization focus its efforts on the areas of greatest impact.

## Key Questions to Answer
The study will focus on answering the following questions:

1.  **Departmental Analysis:** Which departments or job titles show the highest turnover rate?
2.  **Demographic & Tenure Analysis:** Is there a correlation between an employee's age or length of service and their likelihood of leaving? At what point in their career is an employee most likely to leave?
3.  **Temporal Analysis:** How has the turnover rate evolved over the 10-year period?
4.  **Geographic Analysis:** Are there any geographic locations (city/store) that stand out with particularly high or low turnover?
5.  **Root Cause Analysis:** What are the most common termination reasons (`termreason_desc`), and how are they distributed across different employee segments?

## Methodology and Tools
* **Data Source:** The analysis is based on the `MFG10YearTerminationData.csv` file.
* **Analysis Tool:** The entire process of data cleaning, transformation, metrics analysis, and visualization was performed using **Microsoft Excel**.
* **Version Control:** This repository is managed with **Git** and **GitHub**. The data file (`.xlsx`) where the analysis is performed is excluded from version control via the `.gitignore` file to keep the repository lightweight.
